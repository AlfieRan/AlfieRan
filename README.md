### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Alfie Ranstead** and I make stuff on computers.

quick warning - Most of my projects are either private or not on here, which is why I have so few repos.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an entertainment platform named "monopage", you can visit it at https://monopage.app although I am currently working on the backend so there is just a temporary page at that link currently.
- I also have a youtube channel (https://youtube.com/c/unofedeo) although I'm more interested in the algorithm than actually making videos so I don't upload much.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths & Physics for A Level and will be (hopefully) taking computer science at university.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on MonoPage in the future, provided it reaches a point upon which it gains investment and I can afford to pay collaborators fairly.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I probably won't have an educated answer but I will have **an** answer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email uno.fedeo@gmail.com or alfie.ranstead@outlook.com, although my outlook tends to get a bit more spam so I may miss your email if you send one there.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: any.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made FunkyTabs, and it's pretty Funky
