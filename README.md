### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Alfie Ranstead** and I make stuff on computers.

quick warning - Most of my projects are either private or not on here, which is why I have so few repos.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://mutuals.chat
- I also have a youtube channel (https://youtube.com/c/unofedeo) although I'm more interested in the algorithm than actually making videos so I don't upload much.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths & Physics for A Level and will be (hopefully) taking computer science at university.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email uno.fedeo@gmail.com or alfie.ranstead@outlook.com, although my outlook tends to get a bit more spam so I may miss your email if you send one there.
