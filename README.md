# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Alfie Ranstead** and I make stuff on computers.

I'm a mathematical programmer who's been programming since 2013, although I really got into web development in the summer of 2021 (a couple months before I started actually using github) and have been fullstack developing various web projects non-stop since then. 

### Areas I'm interested in:
 - Full Stack Web Development -> Nextjs + Express Api Typescript Monorepos are the best kind of repos ðŸ”¥
 - A.I. -> Prompt Engineering but also the actual maths behind neural networks ðŸ¤–
 - Recommendation Algorithms -> The maths behind these really really fascinates me and I love to mess around with my own.
 - Complex Stuff with Challenging Maths -> Anything that makes my brain start to hurt is the kind of stuff I'll spend hours on until I fully grasp and solve it!
 - Logically Complex Programming -> I love to break new challenges down and seeing the solutions evolve from simple and small to a complex and large.
