### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Alfie Ranstead** and I make stuff on computers.

quick warning - Most of my projects are either private or not on here, which is why I have so few repos relative to how long I've been programming.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://mutuals.chat and https://monochain.network (although most of the progress for both of these is going on behind the scenes)
- I also have a youtube channel (https://youtube.com/c/unofedeo) although I'm more interested in the algorithm and using video creation as a creative output so I don't upload much.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths & Physics for A Level.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email uno.fedeo@gmail.com or alfie.ranstead@outlook.com, although my outlook tends to get a bit more spam so I may miss your email if you send one there.


And if you've got any interesting projects you're looking for some code hungry programmers to get at, send me an email :)
